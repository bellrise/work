work
----

work is a small Python app which helps you track your time when working.
It offers support multiple projects, flexible timer control with a very
simple interface, along with git integration. See `work help` for a quick
rundown of what you can do.

For autocomplete in zsh, run these commands & restart the terminal:

	su -c 'cp ./zshcomplete.zsh /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Unix/_work'
